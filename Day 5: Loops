Objective
In this challenge, we're going to use loops to help us do some simple math. Check out the Tutorial tab to learn more.

Task
Given an integer, n , print its first 10 multiples. Each multiple n x i (where 1<= i <=10 ) should be printed on a new line in the form: n x i = result.

Input Format

A single integer, .

Constraints

Output Format

Print  lines of output; each line  (where ) contains the  of  in the form:
n x i = result.

Code:

#!/bin/python3

import math
import os
import random
import re
import sys


#if __name__ == '__main__':

n = int(input().strip())
for i in range(1,11):
    result = n * i
    print('{} x {} = {}'.format(n, i, result))
